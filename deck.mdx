### What are we talking about? 🤷🏼‍♂️

The journey so far

How to test: strategies!

---

## Whats the point? 🤔

We 👏 need 👏 confidence 👏

---

### What do I actually test? 🤯

Where the business value is!

---

## The journey so far 🚲

---

#### We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) 🃏

_One stop shop framework_

Implements a DOM to use for testing

Amazing well documented API

---

#### [`@vue/test-utils`](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/) is used in MIS

It works... but _I think_ it is a bit clunky.

---

### What were the issues in testing so far 🐛

- Where snapshot tests fit in

- Testing implementation details

- Needing to mock too much

- Tests are verbose

- Tests take ages to run

---

## How to test :muscle:

---

### Enter [`@testing-library/vue`](https://testing-library.com/) 💃

---

#### Making tests resilient to change 💅🏻

---

#### Sample `<vs-input />` component

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/vue-template-xbq08?fontsize=14" title="Vue Template" allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media" style="width:80%; height:750px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin" />

#### Where do I focus my efforts? 🤔
